### Additional Notes

- **Accessibility Considerations**: Ensure that all interactive elements, such as buttons and links, are keyboard navigable and have appropriate ARIA labels where necessary to enhance accessibility for users with disabilities.

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Test the website across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent appearance and functionality.

- **Version Control**: Use a version control system like Git to track changes and collaborate with others effectively. This is especially useful for managing updates and maintaining the codebase.

- **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a feedback mechanism on the contact form to acknowledge submissions, which can enhance user experience and engagement.
